                <p class="question">Question: What is Emmet?</p>
                <p class="answer">Emmet is a web-developer`s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow: Basically, most text editors out there allow you to store and re-use commonly used code chunks, called “snippets”. While snippets are a good way to boost your productivity, all implementations have common pitfalls: you have to define the snippet first and you can`t extend them in runtime. Emmet takes the snippets idea to a whole new level: you can type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation. Emmet is developed and optimised for web-developers whose workflow depends on HTML/XML and CSS, but can be used with programming languages too.</p>

                <p class="question" style="margin-top: 20px;">Question: What is CDN? Why do we use it?</p>
                <p class="answer">A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications. CDN can stand for content delivery network or content distribution network. When a user visits a website, data from that website's server has to travel across the internet to reach the user's computer. If the user is located far from that server, it will take a long time to load a large file, such as a video or website image. Instead, the website content is stored on CDN servers geographically closer to the users and reaches their computers much faster.<br/><br/><strong>Why is a CDN important?</strong><br/>
                The primary purpose of a content delivery network (CDN) is to reduce latency, or reduce the delay in communication created by a network's design. Because of the global and complex nature of the internet, communication traffic between websites (servers) and their users (clients) has to move over large physical distances. The communication is also two-way, with requests going from the client to the server and responses coming back.
                A CDN improves efficiency by introducing intermediary servers between the client and the website server. These CDN servers manage some of the client-server communications. They decrease web traffic to the web server, reduce bandwidth consumption, and improve the user experience of your applications. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cdn/" target="_blank">Read more..</a></p>
                <p class="question">Why is React known as React?</p>
                <p class="answer">React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook, and the name “React” was chosen because it is meant to help developers build user interfaces that are fast and responsive, or “reactive.”<br/><br/> The library was designed to “react” to changes in data. When data in a React application changes, the components that depend on that data are automatically updated, which allows for efficient and seamless updates to the user interface. The name “React” reflects this reactive nature of the library. The idea behind React is to build reusable components that can be rendered on the front-end, rather than writing a new piece of code every time you need to display something on the screen. This makes it easier and more efficient to build complex user interfaces. React is designed to be easy to use and learn, and it is widely popular among developers because of its performance and flexibility.</p>
                <p class="question">What is crossorigin in script tag?</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>CORS</strong> stands for <strong>Cross Origin Resource Sharing</strong>. CORS is a standard mechanism used to retrieve files from other domains.<br/><br/> Earlier browesers were not allowing to access/retieve files from other domain/origin because of browser's same origin policy and security purpose. Hence CORS mechanism is came in to place. e.g. The domain/origin example.com is requesting a file or making POST request from domain/origin google.com:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>before sending actual <mark>POST</mark> request, the browser will make <mark>Preflight Request or OPTIONS Method</mark> to google.com. broswer will send request along with header including origin/domain information. i.e. example.com and <mark>access-control-request-method:POST</mark> </li>
                     <li>Then google.com server will check the request and sent respons along with the headers. The header will contain: <mark>access-control-allow-origin:* access-control-allow-method:POST</mark>. the value of header access-control-allow-origin can be * or any specified origin set by server.</li>
                     <li>Now broswer will check the response whether the google.com server is allowing to acces the file and then make the actual POST resuest to google.com server.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="answer">
                  The crossorigin attribute on a &lt;script&gt; tag specifies that CORS is supported when loading an external script file from a third party server or domain. <mark>The crossorigin attribute specifies that the script element supports CORS.</mark> The crossorigin attribute has two values anonymous or "" or blank and use-credentials. The value anonymous means a cross-origin request will be sent without credentials and performs basic HTTP authentication. the value means A cross-origin request will be sent with credentials, cookies, and certificate.<br/>
                  <code>&lt;script crossorigin="anonymous" src=""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
                </p>
                <p class="question">What is diference between React and ReactDOM?</p>
                <p class="answer">When building web applications in React, you use two packages: <code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code>.<br/>The react package holds the <code>react</code> source for components, state, props and all the code that is react. The <code>react-dom</code> package as the name implies is the glue between React and the DOM. Often, you will only use it for one single thing: mounting your application to the index.html file with ReactDOM.render().<br/><br/>
                <strong>Why separate them?</strong> <br/>The reason <code>react</code> and <code>ReactDOM</code> were split into two libraries was due to the arrival of <code>React Native</code> (A react platform for mobile development). React components are such a great way to organize UI that it has now spread to mobile to react is used in web and in mobile. <code>react-dom</code> is used only in web apps.</p>
                <p class="question">What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>In development mode</strong>, we can enable and utilize React developer tools, devtools profiler, debugging environment attached with source code. The development version includes extra warnings about common mistakes. It is more developer friendly, readable, will take more size. <br/> <strong>In production mode</strong>, compression and minification of Javascript and other resources happens to reduce size of the code which is not the case when it comes to development mode. It includes extra performance optimizations and strips all error messages. Performance will be much faster in production mode when compared to development mode.</p>
                <p class="question">What is async and defer?</p>
                <p class="answer">The <code>script</code> tag is used to add external js files in our web page. There are three ways where we can ask browser to run our js code:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li><u>Without <code>async</code> and <code>defer</code> attribute in <code>script</code> tag</u>: The browser starts <code>html code</code> parsing line by line, when it comes at <code>script</code> tag. It stops <code>html code</code> parsing and fetch the js file, once file is fetched then browser starts executing the <code>js code</code> in file. Once <code>js code</code> execution is finished then browser resumes <code>html code</code> parsing.</li>
                  <li><u>With <code>async</code> attribute in <code>script</code> tag</u>: The browser starts <code>html code</code> parsing line by line, meanwhile browser starts to fetch the js file when file is ready, it stops <code>html code</code> parsing and starts executing the js code in file. Once <code>js code</code> execution is finished then browser resumes <code>html code</code> parsing.</li>
                  <li><u>With <code>defer</code> attribute in <code>script</code> tag</u>: The browser starts <code>html code</code> parsing line by line, meanwhile browser starts to fetch the js file when file is ready, it continues with <code>html code</code> parsing and once <code>html code</code> parsing is finished then it starts <code>js code</code> excution.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We should use <code>defer</code> most of times if there are multiple js file in our website and if one js file is dependent on other js file. If js file is independent then we can use <code>async</code></p>
