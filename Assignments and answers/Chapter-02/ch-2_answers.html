                <p class="question">What is NPM?</p>
                <p class="answer">The npm is the world's largest software registry. Generally it manages the packages and modules for Node.js. It's all code is written in JavaScript.The npm is installed when we install node.js application. It has two things, a <code>CLI</code> command line interface to for publishing and downloading packages and an online repository that hosts JavaScript packages. Each package has it's own package.json file. So whenever we initialiaze npm by command <code>npm init</code> to run our project as npm package. It will create <code>package.json</code> file. <code>package.json</code> file is configuration file of that package. It will contain :</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>name</strong>: name of JavaScript package/project</li>
                    <li><strong>version</strong>: the version of your project.</li>
                    <li><strong>description</strong>: the project's description</li>
                    <li><strong>license</strong>: the project's license</li>
                    <li>It also contains <strong>scripts</strong> property that can be defined to run command-line tools that are installed in the project's local context. e.g. format,lint,jest etc</li>
                    <li>It also contains <strong>depedencies</strong> and <strong>DevDependencies</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p class="question">What is "parcel/webpack"? why do we need it?</p>
                <p class="answer">The <code>parcel</code> and <code>webpack</code> are bundlers. The bundler is a tool where it bundles all you javascript files and all depedencies in to single file. In React, bundlers are used to combine all the JavaScript files that make up a React application into a single file that can be loaded by a web browser. This is done to reduce the number of HTTP requests that a browser has to make to load a web page, which can significantly improve the performance of a React application.
                Bundlers in React can also be used to perform other tasks, such as transpiling code from newer versions of JavaScript to older versions that are supported by all browsers, and optimizing images and other assets</p>
                <p class="question">What is "parcel-cache"?</p>
                <p class="answer">The .cache folder (or .parcel-cache in parcel v2) stores information about your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode.</p>
                <p class="question">what is npx?</p>
                <p class="answer">The <code>npx</code> stands for <strong>Node Package Execute</strong> and it comes with the npm, when you installed npm above 5.2.0 version then automatically npx will installed. It is an npm package runner that can execute any package that you want from the npm registry without even installing that package.</p>
                <p class="question">what is deifference between "DevDependencies" vs "depedencies"?</p>
                <p class="answer">In every web application project, we have a file called package.json. This file contains all the relevant data regarding the project i.e. metadata. Starting from all the dependencies used to all the version numbers are present in the file.<br/><br/><strong>depedencies</strong> : In package.json file, there is an object called <code>dependencies</code> and it consists of all the packages that are used in the project with its version number. So, whenever you install any library that is required in your project that library you can find it in the dependencies object. Generally it is used for production enviornment.<br/> e.g.<code>npm install package_name</code> then after installing, you will see entry of this package name with version in <code>dependencies</code> object in <code>package.json</code> file.<br/><br/><strong>DevDependencies</strong> : In package.json file, there is an object called as dev Dependencies and it consists of all the packages that are used in the project in its development phase and not in the production or testing environment with its version number. So, whenever you want to install any library that is required only in your development phase then you can find it in the dev Dependencies object.<br/> e.g.<code>npm install package_name --save-dev</code> then after installing, you will see entry of this package name with version in <code>devDependencies</code> object in <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
                <p class="question">what is tree shaking?</p>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Tree shaking</strong> is a term commonly used within a JavaScript context to describe the removal of dead code. It relies on the import and export statements to detect if code modules are exported and imported for use between JavaScript files. In modern JavaScript applications, we use module bundlers to automatically remove dead code when bundling multiple JavaScript files into single files. This is important for preparing code that is production ready, for example with clean structures and minimal file size. Parcel also statically analyzes the imports and exports of each module, and removes everything that isn't used. This is called "tree shaking" or "dead code elimination". Tree shaking is supported for both static and dynamic import, CommonJS and ES modules, and even across languages with CSS modules.</p>
                <p class="question">What is Hot module Replacement?</p>
                <p class="answer">Hot Module Replacement improves the development experience by updating modules in the browser at runtime without needing a whole page refresh. This means that application state can be retained as you change small things in your code. The CSS changes are automatically applied via HMR with no page reload necessary. This is also true when using a framework with HMR support built in, like React (via Fast Refresh), and Vue.</p>
                <p class="question">List down fourite 5 superpowers or Parcel and describe any 3 of then in your words?</p>
                <ol class="answer">
                    <li><strong>Zero configuration:</strong> The "zero-configuration" feature simplifies project setup. Developers can start coding right away without worrying about extensive configuration files. Parcel's ability to detect and configure project settings based on the file structure reduces the initial setup time and complexity. </li>
                    <li><strong>Blazing Fast Builds:</strong> Parcel's speed is a game-changer for development. It optimizes the build process by caching and reusing intermediate artifacts, making subsequent builds incredibly fast. This rapid feedback loop encourages a more efficient development workflow. </li>
                    <li><strong>Support for Multiple File Types:</strong> Parcel's ability to handle various file types out of the box simplifies the development process. Whether you're working with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, or images, Parcel can bundle them without the need for additional configuration or plugins. This versatility streamlines project setup and management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hot Module Replacement:</strong> Parcel supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR), enabling real-time code updates without manual browser refresh</li>
                    <li><strong>Automatic Dependency Resolution:</strong> Automatic dependency resolution simplifies the management of third-party libraries and their inclusion in the project.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="question">What is .gitignore? What should we add and not add into it ?</p>
                <p class="answer">A <code>gitignore</code> file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. A gitignore is the file where we add the files and folder which are not supposed to be pushed into the git repository. E.g., the files which can be generated again from other files (e.g. node_modules, dist, .parcel-cache, etc.) are not required to be pushed into the git repo.</p>
                <p class="question">What is difference between <code>package.json</code> and <code>package-lock.json</code>?</p>
                <p class="answer">As we initialize your node application, we will see three files installed in your app that is <code>node_modules</code>, <code>package.json</code>, and <code>package-lock.json</code>. A <code>package.json</code> file contains metadata about the project and also the functional dependencies that is required by the application. A <code>package-lock.json</code> is created for locking the dependency with the installed version. It will install the exact latest version of that package in your application and save it in package.json.</p>

                <p class="question">What is <code>node_modules</code>? Is it good idea to push that to git?</p>
                <p class="answer"><code>node_modules</code> is a directory in Node.js projects that stores external libraries and modules. It is not advisable to push it to Git because of its size and redundancy with package files. As these files are automatically generated and it's code may change based on the dependency version. Also it can make repository larger unnecessarily.</p>
                <p class="question">What is browserslists?</p>
                <p class="answer">Browserslist is a configuration that specifies the browsers and versions which your web project should support. It is used by various development tools to apply browser-specific optimizations and ensure cross-browser compatibility.</p>
                <p class="question">What are vite, webpack and parcel?</p>
                <p class="answer">The <code>vite</code>, <code>webpack</code> and <code>parcel</code> are bundlers. These tools cater to different project needs and developer preferences, with Vite focusing on speed and efficiency, Webpack offering flexibility and customization, and Parcel prioritizing simplicity and ease of use.</p>

                    <p class="question"> what is ^ caret and ~ tilda in </p>
                    <p class="answer"><strong>Caret (^)</strong>: The caret (^) allows compatible updates but restricts breaking changes.<br/>
                        Example: "dependencies": { "package-name": "^1.2.3" } permits versions from 1.2.3 up to, but not including, 2.0.0.<br/><br/><strong>Tilde (~)</strong>: The tilde (~) allows updates to patch versions but restricts minor and major changes.<br/>
                        Example: "dependencies": { "package-name": "~1.2.3" } allows versions from 1.2.3 up to, but not including, 1.3.0.</p>
                    <p class="question">Read About Script types in HTML ?</p>
                    <p class="answer"><strong> Inline scripts </strong>: These are JavaScript code blocks placed directly within the HTML document, enclosed in <code>script</code> tags. They can be in the <code>head</code> or <code>body</code> sections.<br/>
                    <strong> External script </strong>: These are JavaScript files linked to the HTML document using the <code>script</code> tag <code>src</code> attribute. They can be in the <code>head</code> or <code>body</code> sections.<br/><br/>
                    In HTML, the type attribute in the <code>script</code> tag specifies the content type of the script being included. Here are the commonly used type values:
                    <strong><code>text/javascript</code></strong>: Specifies that the content is JavaScript code. This type is widely supported and used by default if the type attribute is omitted.<br/>
                    <strong><code>module</code></strong>: Indicates that the script is a JavaScript module, allowing for modular code organization with features like import and export.<br/>
                    <strong><code>application/json</code></strong>: Defines JSON data. Not commonly used for scripts but rather for embedding JSON data within the HTML document.<br/>
                    <strong><code>text/html</code></strong>: Rarely used for scripts; typically used to embed HTML code as a script.<br/>
                    <strong><code>text/css</code></strong>: Specifies that the content is CSS code. Rarely used in modern development due to the separation of CSS in separate files.<br/>
                    <strong><code>text/plain</code></strong>: Specifies plain text, not treated as executable code.</p>
